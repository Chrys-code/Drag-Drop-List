# Vanilla JS Drag-Drop-List
Drag &amp; Drop List using LocalStorage handled with snapshots

This is a Vanilla JavaScript project.
Been learning a lot in the past year but as I finished to cover topics in JS frameworks and stuff... SSG, SSR, PWA, JAM, MERN-stack. I decided to go back to the roots; Vanilla JavaScript.
As a project to start off on a different level I used JavaScript so far I decided to create a Trello-clone by not using any external help, just to see if I can do it or how long will it take.

I have to admit I restarted the project 4 times. Not because I couldn't do it but I did not want to end up on real spaghetti code. Practice makes perfection right?

This project made the spotlight on many things I have been questioning...

 - Understand the way of thinking to approach a project. (You know the structure how will I handle the problem)
 - The actual build up of the application. How to apply what I learned so far? Understanding step-to-step.
 - I was questioning myself every step: How would an experienced developer do? - yeah this is why I ended up restarting 4 times, because I knew I can do it better/cleaner
 - Still need a lot to go, but I definietly felt different way of thinking and had different ideas on each try.
 
In short this project taught me a lot.
